-POINTLESS-
The game used the following AI techniques...
	1. A* Pathing
		The path finding maps paths throughout the generated city.

	2. Flocking + General Steering
		Flocking controls agents' motions in groups and steering 
		controls their motion in finer sections of the pathing.

	3. Fuzzy Logic
		Fuzzy Logic controls what objective each agent is currently
		trying to achieve. 

	4. Genetic Algorithms
		The genetic algorith is evolving the agents throughout each
		level. The scoring function is dependent on survival time and
		damage dealt.
